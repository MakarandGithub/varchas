				<p>General rules for all lifts</p><br>
<ol>

<li>The technique known as “hooking” is permitted. It consists of covering the last 
joint of the thumb with the other fingers of the same hand at the moment of 
gripping the barbell.
</li>
<li>In all lifts, the referees must count as “No lift” any unfinished attempt in which 
the barbell has reached the height of the knees.
</li>
<li>After the referees signal to lower the barbell, the lifter must lower it in front of 
the body and not let it drop either deliberately or accidentally. The grip on the 
barbell may be released when it has passed the level of the waist.
</li>
<li>A competitor, who cannot fully extend the elbow due to an anatomical 
deformation, must report this fact to the three referees and the Jury before the 
start of the competition.
</li>
<li>When snatching or cleaning in the squat style, the lifter may help the recovery 
by making swinging and rocking movements of the body.
</li>
<li>The use of grease, oil, water, talcum or any similar lubricant on the thighs is 
forbidden. Lifters are not permitted to have any substance on their thighs when 
arriving in the competition area. A lifter who uses any lubricant is ordered to 
remove it.  During the removal the clock goes on.  
</li><li>The use of chalk (magnesium) on the hands, thighs, etc., is permitted.
