				<p>Tournament rules and information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Limit on number on players: 5 (4 + 1 reserve) 
</li><li>
Time Control: 1 hour per side
</li>
<li>The board order of players should be given beforehand to the committee. It cannot be changed 
except as per the substitution rule.
</li>
<li>In case of a 2-2 draw between the playing team in critical rounds, three blitz matches will be 
played between the best players of the teams. Captains of both the teams will report the name of 
the best player to the organizer confidentially. In case of further draw, a final Armageddon match 
will be held.
</li>
<li>Rule for substitution: "Roll over substitution" - The boards lower to the board on which 
substitution is made would slide one board till the board of substitution.
<br>
Example 1: Assume following board order- A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4, Substitute player E. In case, the player 
A (on board 1) is to be substituted. New board order should be B-1, C-2, D-3, E-4 (Not playing-A).
<br>
Example 2: Assume following board order- A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4.Substitute player E. In case, the player C 
(on board 3) is to be substituted. New board order should be A-1, B-2, D-3, E-4 (Not playing-C).
Violation of rules of substitution could lead to '0-4' loss to the violating team for that round.
</li>
<li>Contact the organizers to clear your confusion/dispute. If a player has a disagreement, he/she 
should stop the clock, contact an arbiter and ask for a solution. The chess clock should be stopped 
before calling organizer.
</li>
<li>It is expected that players record the moves. (A sheet would be provided.)It may help to resolve 
some disputes. At the end of game, a signed copy (by both players) of result sheet should be handed 
over to organizing committee. The moves should be written using standard chess notation.
</li>
<li>No prompting is allowed. Any person found guilty for prompting would be disqualified from the 
tournament and strict action would be taken against the team to which he/she belongs.
</li>
<li>A player or his/her team can be disqualified if his/her conduct in the tournament hall is not found 
satisfactory.
</li>
<li>After the game is over, both the players should leave the table immediately. However, captains of 
the playing team can stay inside the playing arena even if his/her match is over.
</li>
<li>Walkover would be given to the player if his/her opponent does not turn up within 15 minutes 
after the round has started. Any player absent from the playing room or board for more than 15 
minutes without permission from the organizers may have his/her game forfeited due to 
unsportsmanlike conduct.
</li>
<li>Please switch off your mobile or keep it in silent mode. Everyone present in the hall is expected 
to maintain silence. Violating team will be subject to a penalty, and may even have to forfeit their 
game.</li>
